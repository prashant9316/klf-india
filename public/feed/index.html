					<description><![CDATA[<p>As we head into the end of the year, we ask ourselves whether these great markets can continue without pausing. With the S&#038;P index up over 25 per cent and European equity markets not far behind, we are concerned that markets are getting ahead of future expectations. The pace of returns has been spectacular this year, fuelled by both good news on the recovery, economic and earnings fronts, and ample liquidity. However, we caution that liquidity conditions may be less friendly as we peer ahead to 2022. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As stock markets, at least in the US and Europe, climb to new highs, investors have become nervous that a correction might lie ahead. After all, the S&#038;P index in the US is on track for its seventh straight monthly advance, the longest winning streak since January 2018. The US stock market has also rebounded by more than 100% from its March 2020 lows; this represents one of the strongest one-year gains since World War II. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As we enter the third quarter, investors are greeted with both optimism and concern. Optimism because there is still a strong case for above-average growth in the years ahead, but concern because the nature of this growth is likely to change. The tailwind of the fiscal and monetary-fuelled pandemic recovery is shifting to a lower but perhaps more sustainable trajectory, led by the consumer and corporate sectors. We are calling this switch: Slowing and More Uncertain Macro to Vibrant and More Dynamic Micro.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Having suffered an almost-inevitable share price slump during the pandemic, long-income specialist LXi REIT has been given something of a caffeine boost during recent months – fitting given the investor’s new-found focus on drive-through coffee outlets. An equity issuance in March – its fourth since a 2017 initial public offering – was a roaring success, raising the company £125m compared to a target of £75m and bringing a raft of new investors onto its share register. Its share price is now close to its post-IPO high from late 2019.</p>
